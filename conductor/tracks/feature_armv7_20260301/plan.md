# Implementation Plan: feature_armv7_20260301

## Phase 1: Architecture & Documentation Scaffolding [checkpoint: d66f98e]
- [x] Task: Create architecture-specific directory structure. [188af50]
    - [x] Create `src/armv7/` directory.
- [x] Task: Update `docs/syscalls.md` with ARMv7 register map and syscall numbers. [9117ad7]
    - [x] Research and document ARMv7 syscalls (read: 3, write: 4, open: 5, close: 6, exit: 1).
    - [x] Add ARMv7 register map (R7 for syscall number, R0-R6 for arguments).
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Architecture & Documentation Scaffolding' (Protocol in workflow.md) [d66f98e]

## Phase 2: Build & Execution Automation [checkpoint: e524ae1]
- [x] Task: Enhance `Taskfile.yml` with ARMv7 tasks. [036079d]
    - [x] Add `assy:armv7`, `link:armv7`, `build:armv7`, and `run:armv7` tasks.
    - [x] Update generic `build` task to support `armv7l`.
    - [x] Update generic `test` task to support `armv7l`.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Build & Execution Automation' (Protocol in workflow.md) [e524ae1]

## Phase 3: Automated Verification
- [x] Task: Implement `tests/verify_armv7.sh` verification script. [31be8be]
    - [x] Write Red Phase: Create script that fails initially.
    - [x] Write Green Phase: Ensure script passes when ARMv7 binary exists and output is correct.
- [~] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Automated Verification' (Protocol in workflow.md)
