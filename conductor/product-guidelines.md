# Product Guidelines: amd64-sys-fetch\n\n## Development Principles\n* **Assembly-First:** The primary goal is learning x86_64 assembly. High-level abstractions are discouraged.\n* **Direct I/O:** Use native Linux system calls (`syscall`) instead of library functions.\n* **Minimalist Architecture:** Prioritize linear execution and explicit register management.\n\n## Project Structure & Conventions\n* **Source:** All `.asm` files reside in `src/`.\n* **Build Artifacts:** Compiled objects (`.o`) and final binaries should be generated within a `build/` directory (if not already managed by a Makefile or Taskfile).\n* **Code Style:** Use NASM-compatible syntax and follow consistent indentation for labels, instructions, and operands.\n\n## Documentation Standards\n* **Detailed Comments:** Every block of assembly should be thoroughly commented to explain register usage, logic, and intended side effects.\n* **Reference Tracking:** Maintain a list of used system calls (e.g., in `docs/references.md`) including their opcode, register map, and return values.\n\n## UX/CLI Principles\n* **Speed:** The tool must execute and exit within milliseconds.\n* **Clean Output:** Display only the requested metrics by default, without unnecessary text or banners.
