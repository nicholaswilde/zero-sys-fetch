# Product Definition: amd64-sys-fetch\n\n## Vision\nA hands-on project to master x86_64 assembly language by developing high-performance, dependency-free CLI tools for Linux system monitoring.\n\n## Core Goals\n* **Learning & Mastery:** Deepen understanding of CPU registers, memory management, and low-level system interactions.\n* **Performance & Efficiency:** Leverage pure assembly and native system calls to minimize resource usage and maximize execution speed.\n* **Portability & Simplicity:** Create binaries that run natively on headless Linux environments without external library requirements (libc-free).\n\n## Targeted Metrics\n* **System Load Average:** Direct retrieval from `/proc/loadavg` using efficient file I/O and custom parsing.\n\n## Design Constraints & Protocol\n* **Source Control:** Only the human developer (user) modifies `.asm` or assembly files.\n* **Agent Role:** The AI agent acts as a facilitator, providing documentation, managing the build/run lifecycle, and researching system call references and optimization techniques.\n* **Stack:** NASM (Netwide Assembler), `ld` (GNU Linker), and the Linux x86_64 ABI.
